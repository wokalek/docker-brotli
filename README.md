## About

This is a super simple and easy to read nginx docker alpine-based image.

## What's inside

- Only default [nginx modules](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)
- [`ngx_brotli`](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli) â€” brotli algorithm compression
- Ports `80` and `443` are exposed by default

## Why?

This is the smallest and most up-to-date nginx-brotli image you can find.

The most popular `fholzer/nginx-brotli` with 1 million pools is 13.96 MB, `wokalek/nginx-brotli` is **9.36 MB** (compressed size, compare 1.25.1 tags).

Alpine! Everyone loves alpine. Other images you may find use different base images.

And of course this dockerfile can be perfect for your nginx build with your modules! Take a look.
